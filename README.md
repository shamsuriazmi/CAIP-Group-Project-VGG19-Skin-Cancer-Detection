# CAIP-Group-Project-VGG19-Skin-Cancer-Detection

Capstone Project : VGG19 Skin Cancer Detection

## Problem Statement

- What is actually considered that skin cancer cells is cancerous (danger zone) malignant or benign?
- How to achieve better and cheaper prediction than a dermatologist?

## Objective

- To adapt VGG19 to suit the cancer datasets
- To evaluate the accuracy of the prediction

## Solution 

- Skin Cancer detection using VGG19 Image Classification

## Dataset

- Kaggle Skin Cancer (Malignant vs Benign)

## VGG19 Architecture

- VGG19 is a deep CNN used to classify images
- Variant of VGG model which consists of 19 layers (16 convolution layers, 3 Fully connected layer, 5 MaxPool layers and 1 SoftMax layer)
- Weights are easily available with other frameworks like keras
- VGG19 has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images
